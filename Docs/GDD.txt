- Every time you enter a room, enemies reset
- Because there are lot's of rooms (9) and you have to constantly loop trough the same rooms, the levels should be quite easy
- Transitions between rooms is just a black screen lasting a second or two

- The character has two actions:
    Attack - single short hit with the umbrella
    Block - Simple version: While blocking take reduced damage from the front. Cool version: While blocking, block projectiles and send them back (always jump back to the one who threw)
